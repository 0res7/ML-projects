# Project Description: Classification of Arrhythmia

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify different types of cardiac arrhythmia from electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The goal is to predict whether a person has arrhythmia and, if so, to classify it into one of the 12 available arrhythmia categories.

## Dataset Used
The project utilizes the Arrhythmia dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 452 instances and 279 features, which include patient information like age, sex, height, and weight, as well as various measurements extracted from their ECG readings.

The dataset is imbalanced, with a large number of instances belonging to the "normal" class and fewer instances for the different types of arrhythmia.

## ML Pipeline
The machine learning pipeline in this project can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    - The data is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
    - **Handling Missing Values**: The dataset contains missing values represented by '?'. These are first replaced with `numpy.NAN` and then imputed using the mean of the respective columns with `SimpleImputer`.
    - **Outlier Handling**: The notebook identifies and handles outliers in the 'Height' feature by replacing them with more reasonable values.
    - **Feature Engineering**: The notebook creates a list of column names to make the dataset more interpretable.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - The notebook performs EDA to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between different features.
    - **Class Distribution**: The distribution of the different arrhythmia classes is visualized using a count plot and a pie chart. This reveals the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
    - **Pairwise Relationships**: A pair grid is used to visualize the pairwise relationships between the 'Age', 'Sex', 'Height', and 'Weight' features.

3.  **Dimensionality Reduction**:
    - Due to the high number of features (278) compared to the number of instances (452), dimensionality reduction is a crucial step.
    - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: The notebook applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance. The number of principal components is chosen to be 150.

4.  **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - The notebook trains and evaluates several classification models on the PCA-transformed data:
        - **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance.
        - **Decision Tree Classifier**: A single decision tree model.
        - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification algorithm that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate the classes.
        - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.
    - The models are evaluated using accuracy score and a confusion matrix.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
    - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
    - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
    - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
    - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and evaluation.

## Key Insights
- The Arrhythmia dataset is a challenging dataset due to its high dimensionality and class imbalance.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers, is a critical step in achieving good model performance.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA is essential for this dataset to reduce the computational complexity and potentially improve the performance of the models.
- The Random Forest Classifier achieves the highest accuracy among the models tested, which is expected as ensemble methods are often more robust and perform well on complex datasets.
