## üöÄ How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds ‚Äî new ML projects, improvements to existing ones, bug fixes, refactoring, or documentation enhancements.

### ‚úÖ Code Contributions

If you're new to open source, start with GitHub‚Äôs guide:

[How to Create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).

**Steps:**

* Browse or open [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/0res7/Machine-Learning-Projects/issues).
* Comment on an issue you'd like to work on, and wait for it to be assigned to you.
* Once assigned, create a feature branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request (PR).
* A maintainer will review your PR before merging.

### üîë Best Practices

* Use **present-tense, imperative verbs** in commits: `Add`, `Fix`, `Refactor`, not `Added`, `Fixing`, etc.
* Ensure code is  **readable, commented** , and uses  **descriptive names** .
* Avoid raising PRs just for minor comment additions unless you're refactoring.
* Test your code if applicable ‚Äî include test data or examples.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Standards and Coding Style

### General

* Projects must be written in  **Python 3.x** .
* Provide a `README.md` per project with:
  * Description
  * Usage steps
  * Dependencies
  * Example input/output
* Use consistent formatting (PEP8 preferred).
* Write functions and modules that are  **modular and reusable** .

### Naming & Comments

* Use clear, descriptive names (`load_model_weights()` not `lmd()`).
* Include **docstrings** and **inline comments** where necessary.
* Remove unused code, print/debug statements before submitting.

  * Purpose of the project
  * Input format
  * Output samples
  * How to run the code
  * Dependencies (can be listed in `requirements.txt`)
* Prefer Markdown formatting (`**bold**`, headers, code blocks) for clarity.
