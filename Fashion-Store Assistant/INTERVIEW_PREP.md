## Conceptual Questions

**Q1: What is a Large Language Model (LLM) and how is it used in this project?**

**A1:** A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on a massive amount of text data to understand and generate human-like language. In this project, an LLM (specifically, GPT-4o) is used for several key tasks:

*   **Email Classification**: The LLM is used to classify incoming emails into two categories: "Order Request" or "Product Inquiry". It does this by analyzing the text of the email and identifying the user's intent.
*   **Information Extraction**: For emails classified as "Order Request", the LLM is used to extract specific pieces of information from the email body, such as the product name, size, and quantity.
*   **Response Generation**: The LLM is used to generate natural and helpful responses to the user's emails. For product inquiries, it uses the retrieved information from the product catalog to answer the user's questions. For order requests, it generates a response based on the stock status of the requested product.

**Q2: What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and how is it used in this project?**

**A2:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of a pre-trained LLM with an external knowledge base. It works by first retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base and then using that information to generate a more accurate and informative response.

In this project, RAG is used to handle product inquiries. The product catalog is stored in a vector store, which allows for efficient retrieval of relevant product information. When a user asks a question about a product, the system first retrieves the relevant product information from the vector store and then uses that information to generate a response with the LLM.

**Q3: What is a vector store and how is it used in this project?**

**A3:** A vector store is a type of database that is designed for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors. In this project, a vector store (specifically, ChromaDB) is used to store the embeddings of the product descriptions. An embedding is a numerical representation of a piece of text that captures its semantic meaning.

When a user asks a question about a product, the system first converts the user's query into an embedding and then uses that embedding to search the vector store for the most similar product descriptions. The retrieved product descriptions are then used to generate a response.

## Technical Questions

**Q4: What is the OpenAI API and how is it used in this project?**

**A4:** The OpenAI API is a platform that provides access to OpenAI's powerful language models, such as GPT-4o. In this project, the OpenAI API is used to make calls to the GPT-4o model to perform the tasks of email classification, information extraction, and response generation.

**Q5: What is LangChain and how is it used in this project?**

**A5:** LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to build complex applications with LLMs. In this project, LangChain is used to orchestrate the different components of the system, such as the LLM, the vector store, and the different prompts.

**Q6: What is ChromaDB and how is it used in this project?**

**A6:** ChromaDB is an open-source vector store that is designed for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors. In this project, ChromaDB is used to store the embeddings of the product descriptions. It provides a simple and efficient way to create and manage the vector store.

## Project-specific Questions

**Q7: How does the system classify emails into "Order Request" and "Product Inquiry"?**

**A7:** The system uses a fine-tuned LLM to classify the emails. The model is trained on a dataset of emails that have been manually labeled as either "Order Request" or "Product Inquiry". The model learns to identify the patterns and keywords that are associated with each category.

**Q8: How does the system extract information from order requests?**

**A8:** The system uses the LLM to extract key information from the email body, such as the product name, size, and quantity. This is done by providing the LLM with a prompt that asks it to extract the relevant information from the email.

**Q9: How does the system generate responses to product inquiries?**

**A9:** The system uses RAG to generate responses to product inquiries. It first retrieves relevant product information from the vector store and then uses that information to generate a response with the LLM. The prompt for the LLM includes the user's query and the retrieved product information, which helps the LLM to generate a more accurate and informative response.

**Q10: How could you improve the performance of the system?**

**A10:** There are several ways to potentially improve the performance of the system:
*   **More Data**: I could try to obtain more labeled data to fine-tune the LLM on. This could help to improve the accuracy of the email classification and information extraction tasks.
*   **Better Prompts**: I could experiment with different prompts to see if I can get better results from the LLM.
*   **Different Models**: I could try using different LLMs to see if they perform better on this task.
*   **More Sophisticated RAG**: I could try using a more sophisticated RAG system that is able to retrieve information from multiple sources, such as the product catalog and customer reviews.
