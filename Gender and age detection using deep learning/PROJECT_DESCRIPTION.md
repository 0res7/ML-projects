# Project Description: Gender and Age Detection

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can detect a person's gender and age from an image or a live video stream. The model first detects the face in the image and then uses two separate deep learning models to predict the gender and age of the person.

## Models Used
The project uses three pre-trained deep learning models:

- **Face Detection Model**: A Caffe model based on the Single Shot-Multibox Detector (SSD) framework with a ResNet-10 backbone. This model is used to detect the location of the face in the image.
- **Gender Prediction Model**: A Caffe model that has been trained to predict the gender of a person from a facial image. The model outputs a probability distribution over two classes: "Male" and "Female".
- **Age Prediction Model**: A Caffe model that has been trained to predict the age of a person from a facial image. The model outputs a probability distribution over eight age ranges: (0-2), (4-6), (8-12), (15-20), (25-32), (38-43), (48-53), and (60-100).

## ML Pipeline
The machine learning pipeline in this project can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Face Detection**: The input image is first passed through the face detection model to identify the location of the face. The model outputs a bounding box for each detected face.

2.  **Face Extraction**: The face is then extracted from the image using the bounding box coordinates.

3.  **Gender and Age Prediction**: The extracted face is then passed through the gender and age prediction models to get the predicted gender and age range.

4.  **Output**: The predicted gender and age are then displayed on the output image.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
    - **OpenCV**: For image and video processing, as well as for loading and running the deep learning models.
    - **argparse**: For parsing command-line arguments.

## Key Insights
- The use of pre-trained deep learning models allows for accurate and efficient gender and age detection without the need for training a model from scratch.
- The project demonstrates how to use OpenCV's DNN module to load and run pre-trained Caffe models.
- The project can be used as a starting point for building more advanced applications, such as a system for targeted advertising or a system for monitoring the age and gender of customers in a retail store.
